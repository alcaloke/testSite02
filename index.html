    <h2>Welcome to your new sensory experience</h2>

    <p class="autoscroll">Reality is composed of light; more specifically, luminosity.
      Sound Mirror's Color Organ is a technological tool that allows
      the user to enhance their ability to see such luminosity.
      How? By synchronising the light with sound; where the user is
      able to see that light is no different to other sensory information.
      All is a play of luminosity.
