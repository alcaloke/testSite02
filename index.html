        <h2>Fearless state of mind</h2>
        <p>With a fearless mind one can interact with one's reality with total freedom. How? Since one is able to see everything in their innate purity. This is only possible once ego has been destroyed; where one is no longer clouded by all the confusion that the conceptual mind creates.</p>

        <h2>Loving presence</h2>
        <p>True compassion is not an act but a sense of being; a loving presence. Such authentic presence arises from true understanding & practice of equanimity. All human beings are accepted for who they are; no different to oneself & contain the seed of enlightment. If one is awake, it must be one's duty to help the other human beings to also see the light</p>

        <h2>Humility & simplicity</h2>
        <p>Humility is the foundation of conditioning oneself & life so that everything becomes simple. Only out of simplicity; it is possible to become how one truly is. In a complicated mind, there is no room for growth. One cannot learn to unlearn.</p>

    <h2>Welcome to your new sensory experience</h2>
    <div id="backgroundClip"></div>
    <p class="autoscroll">Reality is composed of light; more specifically, luminosity.
      Sound Mirror's Color Organ is a technological tool that allows
      the user to enhance their ability to see such luminosity.
      How? By synchronising the light with sound; where the user is
      able to see that light is no different to other sensory information.
      All is a play of luminosity.
